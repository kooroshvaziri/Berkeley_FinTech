# Berkeley FinTech: Frameworks, Applications, and Strategies

Here you will find my capstone project, giftopia, for the FinTech program offerred through UC Berkeley's ExecEd.

With a $900B market cap in 2023 and little regulations, retail gift-cards are a niche and untapped FinTech market estimated to grow to $2T by 2030. This capstone project tends to offer a new framework for a successful startup in this sector.
